        <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    </div>
    <p style="font-size: larger;color:black;margin-left:5px;">Steps followed in this website for data analysis</p>
    <div id="contentbody">
        <div id="contentbodydiv">
            <h3>1. Data Collection</h3>
            <p>This step involves gathering data from various sources such as databases, APIs, web scraping, or manual data entry.
                Data collection should ensure that the data is relevant, accurate, and in a usable format for analysis.
                In this website only excel or csv file are accepting, no data scrapping can be done in this website.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="contentbodydiv">
            <h3>2. Data Inspection</h3>
            <p>
                In this step, you gather information about the data collected. This includes metadata such as column names, data types, and summary statistics.
                Describing the data helps in understanding its structure, patterns, and potential issues.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="contentbodydiv">
            <h3>3. Data Cleaning</h3>
            <p>Null values and duplicate records can affect the quality and accuracy of analysis.
                Removing nulls involves either imputing missing values or dropping rows/columns with null values.
                Removing duplicates ensures that each observation is unique and prevents bias in analysis.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="contentbodydiv">
            <h3>4. Data Visualization</h3>
            <p>Data visualization involves presenting data graphically to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships.
                Types of visualizations include histograms, scatter plots, bar charts, pie charts, box plots, etc.
                Websites like Data to Viz <a href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/">DataVizualisation</a>
                provide clear explanations with examples and visuals for various types of visualizations.

            <h3>5. Data Preprocessing</h3>
            <p>
                Preprocessing involves cleaning and transforming data to prepare it for analysis.
                Steps may include removing noise, handling missing values, scaling features, encoding categorical variables, etc.
                Text preprocessing may involve removing punctuation, stop words, special characters, etc.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="contentbodydiv">
            <h3>6. Data Transformation</h3>
            <p>
                Data Transormation involves converting to vector forms.Converting data to vector form is essential for machine learning algorithms that require numerical input.
                Techniques include one-hot encoding for categorical variables, word embeddings for text data, and scaling for numerical features.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="contentbodydiv">
            <h3>7. Data Spliting</h3>
            <p>This step involves dividing the dataset into two subsets: training data and testing data.
                The training set is used to train the machine learning model, while the test set is used to evaluate its performance.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="contentbodydiv">
            <h3>8. Modelling</h3>
            <p>
                Data Modelling involves in traing the model using algorithms of machine learning and deep learning.
                In machine learning, therer are three different type of learnings. They are Supervised learning, Unsuoervised learning, reinforcement learning.
                <br><i><b>Supervised </b></i>learning algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, etc.
                <br><i><b>Unsupervised </b></i>learning algorithms include k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), etc.
                <br><i><b>Reinforcement </b></i>learning algorithms include Q-learning, deep Q-networks (DQN), policy gradients, etc.
            </p>

            <h3>9. Selecting the Best Model based on Accuracy</h3>
            <p>
                After training multiple models, the best model is selected based on evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc.
                Cross-validation techniques help in assessing the model's performance on unseen data and avoiding overfitting.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="contentbodydiv">
            <h3>10. Prediction</h3>
            <p>
                Once the best model is selected, it can be deployed to make predictions on new or unseen data.
                The model takes input in the form of features and produces output predictions.
